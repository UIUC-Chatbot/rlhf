Computing relies on deterministic systems because computers operate based on instructions (called programs) that always produce the same output for a given input. This is important because it allows us to rely on the results of computations to be consistent and reproducible. Additionally, the concept of determinism is related to the idea of a universal computational device, which is a theoretical machine (like a Turing machine) that can perform any computation that can be computed.""
