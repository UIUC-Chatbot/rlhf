To find the 2's complement representation of a negative number, we flip all the bits of its absolute value and add 1. The range of integers represented by 2's complement in a 5-bit system is from -16 to +15. In a computer that operates on 16-bit values, the range is from -32,768 to +32,767. To convert a 2's complement binary number to decimal, we first check if the leading bit is 0 or 1, which tells us if the number is positive or negative.
