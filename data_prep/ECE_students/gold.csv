"How does a decoder work? How is it different from a multiplexer","A decoder has n input lines, and (2^n) output lines. Each of the n input lines takes in a signal of 0 or 1, and the resulting binary code determines which of the 2n output signals are forwarded to the next part of the system. The remaining output signals do not send a signal, so a decoder can only send signals from one output at any one time. A mux acts similarly to a decoder except the output lines merge into a single “wire” at the end, so a mux has only one output line."
"How does the Branch Opcode work in LC3?","During Branch, the LC3 looks at the value in the cc register, and depending on whether it is positive, negative, or zero, decides whether to jump to a different branch of the code, by changing the program counter value."
"What is a Multiplexer?","A multiplexer acts a selector of multiple different inputs"
"What is de Morgan's Law?","De Morgan’s Law is a way to find out an alternative representation of a given boolean logic. Given two variables A and B, the two main forms to remember are: \n(A + B)' = A' B' (The NOT of A OR B is equal to NOT A AND NOT B)\n(AB)' = A' + B' (The NOT of A AND B is equal to NOT A OR NOT B)"
"What are don’t care values?","'Don’t care values' are used when the output of a boolean function can be left unspecified. Using 'don’t care values' allows you to choose from among several possible logic functions, all of which produce the desired results (as well as some combination of 0s and 1s in place of the 'don’t care values'). Each input combination marked as 'don't care' doubles the number of functions that can be chosen to implement the design, often enabling the logic needed for implementation to be simpler."
"What is a Multiplexer?","A multiplexer acts a selector of multiple different inputs"
"What is a Decoder?","A decoder translates the coded n input bits to a set of 2^n output bits that represent the message's original meaning"
"What is a Bit-Sliced Design","A bit-sliced design is a type of hardware implementation in which multiple copies of a set of combinational logic elements are used to process multiple input bits. This type of design is often used for components such as adders, multipliers, and other arithmetic logic units."
"What is the purpose of the clock signal in a D-latch?","The clock signal enables the D-latch and is thus used to copy the input value and store that input value in the D-latch when the clock signal is high."
"What are the TRAP Vectors in LC3?","TRAP vectors call TRAP subroutines that are in place for specific purposes. There are 5 trap vectors: IN, GETC, OUT, PUT"
"What are the NZP bits in the LC-3 assembly language?","NZP stands for Negative, Zero, Positive, and they are used to indicate to the LC-3 assembler whether the result of an operation is negative, zero, or positive."
"How do I clear a register in the LC-3 assembly language?","You AND the register with the #0, which clears any previous content in the register."
"How do I indicate the end of the program in an LC-3 assembly file?","The .END directive indicates to the LC-3 assembler the end of the assembly file."
"How do I set the memory origination location in an LC-3 assembly file?","The .ORIG directive with the memory location that you want to start at indicates to the assembler the memory location where the program should originate at."
"When would I use 2’s complement in an LC-3 program?","You would use 2’s complement when you need to subtract one number from another since LC-3 does not have a SUBTRACT instruction."
