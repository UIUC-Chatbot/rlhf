      "0 We use a 2’s complement integer to represent positive and negative integers that we wish to perform arithmetic on.\n",
      "1 A sign extension is used when we need to add representations of different lengths, we need to represent them with the same number of bits. A sign extension extends the sign bit of a number by as many bit positions to the left as needed.\n",
      "2 An ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit, it performs arithmetic operations like adding and subtracting on bits.\n",
      "3 The AND function performs a logical AND operation on 2 source operands. The logical AND operation says that if and only if both operands are 1, then the output of the AND operation will be 1.\n",
      "4 The OR function performs a logical OR operation on 2 source operands. The logical OR operation says that if one source operand out of the 2 is 1, then the output of the OR operation will be 1. Additionally, if both source operands are 1, then the output of the OR operation will be 1.\n",
      "5 The NOT function inverts the source operand to get the result of the operation. It only requires one source operand for the function.\n",
      "6 The XOR function performs a logical XOR operation on 2 source operands. The logical XOR operation says that if and only if one of the 2 source operands is 1, then the output of the XOR operation will be 1. If both the operands are 1 or 0, then the result of the XOR operation will be 0.\n",
      "7 It is a crucial relationship between AND and OR functions. The basis of DeMorgan’s Laws says that we complement (perform the NOT operation) on 2 inputs A and B, and then perform the AND operation on the complement of the two inputs, and then take the complement of the result of the operation.\n",
      "8 According to De Morgan’s theorem, a NAND Gate is equivalent to an OR gate with inverted inputs. Thus, by inverting the inputs of the AND Gates, we get the first level of logic comprising of NAND Gates and swapping the OR gate with a NAND gate, we get the second level of logic\n",
      "9 Bit Sliced Digital logic works by creating n copies of the bit slice and replicating them to create logic for n bits instead of just one. This works fine when n is a small number. However, as n gets larger, it becomes prohibitively expensive to implement that many bit slices. Thus, we use a serialized approach where we take a singular bit slice and use Flip Flops to store intermediate bits and feed these bits back into the bit slice. The drawback in using serialised design is that it is more time consuming. Thus the trade off occurs in Logic space(for bit sliced design) and Logic time(for serialized design)\n",
      "10 Answer Memory in modern systems is used to store variable and instructions(something more relevant when students learn LC3). These systems have properties based on the number of bits in the system. Addressability is the way computers identify different memory locations and is determined by the size of the system (also known as the number of bits in the system: 16 in LC3, 64 in x86 etc). The max available address space is calculated by taking 2^n, where n is the size of the system.\n",
      "11 The Von Neumann model is the idea that a computer can be designed with these key components:\\n1. Memory: The computer has a single, unified memory system that can store both data and instructions. This memory is divided into discrete cells, each of which has a unique address.\\n2. Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is responsible for executing instructions stored in memory. It consists of an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) that performs mathematical and logical operations, and a temporary registers that enable these operations\\n3. Control unit: The control unit is responsible for determining what needs to be done by the processing unit. It has 2 components: The Program Counter(Keeps track of the current instruction) and the Instruction Register(Tells the rest of the system what needs to be done for each instruction)\\n4. Input/Output (I/O): The computer has devices for input and output, such as a keyboard, mouse, and display.\\n5. Bus: The bus is a system of wires or channels that connects the CPU, memory, and I/O devices and allows them to communicate with each other.\\nIn the Von Neumann model, instructions and data are stored in the same memory space, and they are accessed using their unique addresses. The CPU retrieves instructions from memory, executes them using the ALU and control unit, and then stores the results back in memory. This cycle of fetch-decode-execute is repeated for each instruction in the program. \\nThe Von Neumann model is relevant because it allows for the creation of powerful, efficient, and flexible computer systems.\n",
      "12 One of the Instructions that any computing system has is the Branch instruction that enables the Program Counter to jump to different locations. Thus, we can create conditions such as when Register R0 is positive, loop back to the start of the instructions in memory. Doing so, we are able to create a loop. By branching to specific locations depending on various values, we are able to create a conditional.\n",
      "13 The TRAP instruction, also known as the HALT instruction, is a type of instruction in computer programming that is used to halt or stop the execution of a program. When a TRAP instruction is encountered in a program, the computer immediately stops executing instructions and enters a special state known as a \"trap\" or \"interrupt\" state.\\nIn this state, execution stops and the program and transfers control to a predefined location in memory where a special routine or interrupt handler is located.\n",
      "14 This depends on the number of bits allocated for the immediate value in the opcode. For example, the ADD opcode allocates 5 bits for the immediate value. As the LC3 is in two’s complement representation, the range of integers that can be used are from -2^4 to (2^4)-1. Or, in other words from -16 to 15.\n",
      "15 The cycle consists of FETCH,DECODE,EVALUATE ADDRESS,OPERAND FETCH,EXECUTE and STORE RESULT. Of these, only fetch and decode are mandatory for every cycle. The remaining steps are optional, depending on the opcode of the instruction. For example, ADD and NOT instructions will not have an Evaluate Address step whereas STI and LDI will have an evaluate address step, as the latter steps require accessing specific memory addresses.\n",
      "16 A TRAP instruction is a service call to the operating system, and performs an automated function for us. In ECE120, there are a few main trap vectors that are used - \\nTRAP #20 - GETC (gets a single character from the keyboard and stores in R0)\\nTRAP #21 - OUT (outputs a value to the screen, that is stored in R0)\\nTRAP #22 - PUTS (outputs a string to the screen)\\nTRAP #23 - IN (reads in a character from the keyboard, saves it to R0, and outputs the character to the screen)\\nTRAP #25 - HALT (ends the execution of the program)\n",
      "17 The Gate Signals enable various data to be sent from one set of Von Neumann Components to another (ie Control unit to Processing Unit). These data signals are sent over the BUS of the LC3(A set of wires that connect the different units). Setting one Gate signal to high, allows that data to be transmitted on the bus. The GatePC sends the current value of the PC to the other parts of the LC3. If multiple Gate signals are set to high, we would be sending sets of different values on which will corrupt the system by causing floating values\n",
      "18 These signals control whether the Register/MAR/MDR components are “turned on” and send an output to other parts of the datapath. If we don’t want to use a particular component for a process in LC3, the LD signal for that component should be set to 0 throughout the process, so as to avoid interrupting signals from other components.\n",
      "19 Using the LC3 simulator, we can step through our program line by line and observe how our register and memory values change each step, and compare that with how the program is expected to function. To speed up the process, we can set up breakpoints to skip through the parts of the program that we know are working fine. Another debugging tool is to print the values to screen by loading it into R0 and using the OUT command.\n",
      "20 As with other assembly and programming languages, the problem can be typically broken down into three types of “blocks” - sequential, conditional and iterative. \\nSequential refers to steps that must take place one after another - these steps should be programmed in LC3 in the same chronological order.\\nConditional refers to steps that take place only if a given condition is true - this can be programmed using the BR opcode and labels, in order to jump to or skip certain parts of the program. \\nIterative refers to steps that must be repeated for a certain number of times, similar to a for loop in C. Iterative steps are represented in LC3 through the BR opcode as well, and a register that is used as a counter value and is decremented by 1 during each iteration of the loop.\n",
      "21 The Opcode is a symbolic name for the opcode of the corresponding LC-3 instruction. The idea is that it is easier to remember an operation by the symbolic name ADD, AND, or LDR than by the four-bit quantity 0001, 0101, or 0110\\nExamples are as follows:\\nADD R1, R1, #1\\nAND R1, R0, R0\\nNOT R0, R0\\nLDR R3, R1, #0\n",
      "22 Labels are symbolic names (alphanumeric) that are used to identify memory locations that are referred to explicitly in the program. The use of labels allows for an easy way to jump between different lines of code in the program\\nThe syntax for creating a label is as follows:\\nPOSITIVELOOP – This is the label\\nADD R1, R1, #1\\n\\n<Additional code may go here>\\n\\nBRnzp POSITIVELOOP – This makes the program jump back to the \\nline of code just under the label that was originally given\n",
      "23 The PCMUX consists of two control signals (2 bits) and specifies which input to the MUX is required during a given clock cycle, depending on the instruction.\n",
      "24 The bits IR[15:12] specifies the opcode of the current LC-3 instruction that is being processed.\n",
      "25 Addressability is the number of bits stored in each memory location, also known as word space. LC3 stores 16 bits in each memory location. Modern computers typically have 64. Address space is the number of unique memory locations that the computer has, and is usually in the form 2n, where n is the number of bits needed to describe the memory location. The LC3 has an address space of 216, meaning each memory location has a “name” that is 16 bits long. So the LC3 memory is 216x16\n",
      "26 The steps are Fetch, Decode, Evaluate Address, Fetch Operands, Execute and Store Result. Fetch and Decode are necessary for every cycle, while the remaining states are optional, depending on the opcode specified.\n",
      "27 They are used as temporary storage of values such that they can be quickly accessed, as accessing a value from memory can be time consuming\n",
      "28 The computer does a “first pass” through the program, where it identifies the memory address of every label in the program, and then builds a symbol table. The computer then does a “second pass” through the program, where it translates the assembly language instructions into machine code.\n",
      "29 First draw a truth table with variables A,B,C and output P. Then group together the conditions that have the same A and B values, such that there are four different groups with 2 conditions in each group. Then determine an expression for P in terms of C for each group,  and those 4 expressions will be the 4 inputs to the MUX. The two select inputs will be A and B.\n",
      "30 When a state J requires waiting for memory access, that state must have 1 as its second bit from the right. Once the memory is ready, the next state that the LC3 moves to must have state number J+2.\n",
      "31 MAR <− PC\\nPC <− PC + 1\\nMDR <−M[MAR]\\nIR <−MDR\n",
      "32 Some decimal values do not have an exact/finite binary representation, similar to ⅓ in decimal. Hence some precision is lost by representing the value in 754-floating point.\n",
      "33 The LC3 ADD opcode only leaves 5 bits for immediate values. Considering that numbers are represented in two’s complement in LC3, this means that the largest immediate value that can be used in the ADD operation is 25-1-1, which is 15. To add numbers larger than that, one would have to store it into another register and use the LDR command.\n",
      "34 The current output of a Moore machine is based solely on its current state, whereas the output of a Mealy machine depends on both its current state and the external inputs.\n",
      "35 De Morgan’s Law is a way to find out an alternative representation of a given boolean logic. Given two variables A and B, the two main forms to remember are:\\n(A + B)’ = A’ B’ (The NOT of A OR B is equal to NOT A AND NOT B)\\n(AB) ‘ = A’ + B’ (The NOT of A AND B is equal to NOT A OR NOT B)\n",
      "36 Overflow can be indicated in a 2’s complement if the result has the wrong sign, such as if 2 positive numbers sum to a negative number or if 2 negative numbers sum to positive numbers.\n",
      "37 If the carry in bit matches the carry out bit, if not, then the overflow has occurred.\n",
      "38 Use one inverter on each input of the OR gate, and use a third inverter on the output of the OR gate.\n",
      "39 PEMDAS (Parenthesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction)\n",
      "40 A universal gate such as a NAND or NOR is easier to fabricate onto a chip and they can be used to create normal/AOI logic gates.\n",
      "41 In a signed representation, the leftmost bit is used to indicate the sign of the number. In an unsigned representation, all bits are used to represent the magnitude of the number, with no bit reserved for indicating the sign. You cannot use unsigned representation to represent negative numbers.\n",
      "42 Fixed-point operations can be implemented with integer arithmetic, which is typically faster than floating-point arithmetic.\n",
      "43 Clock synchronous designs use a system clock to control the timing of all circuit operations. The circuit elements are updated on either the rising or falling edge of the clock signal. Clock asynchronous designs do not rely on a system clock to synchronize the timing of circuits, the circuit elements are designed to operate independently of the clock, using their own timing control.\n",
      "44 Hamming codes are used to detect and correct errors in transmitting data. They are a type of error-correcting code. Hamming codes add parity bits to the original data, the parity bits are used to detect and correct any errors.\n",
      "45 Hamming distance is a measure of the difference between two binary strings of equal length. It is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols in two binary strings are different.\n",
      "46 A tri-state buffer is a digital logic gate that is used to control the flow of data in a digital system. It is effectively a buffer that has a third, enable input, which lets the output be put into a “floating” state. They are commonly used to allow multiple devices to share the same bus without cross-interference.\n",
      "47 A register is a circuit that is used to both store and manipulate data. It is simply a group of flip-flops that are connected together to form a single, larger unit. They are used to temporarily store data that is being actively processed.\n",
      "48 A latch is used to store and manipulate data similar to a register, but a latch can only store a single bit of information at a time.\n",
      "49 A clock abstraction ignores many details from the actual clock signal, instead, a clock abstraction represents the clock with a simple waveform, this makes it much easier to design and analyze digital circuits.\n",
      "50 An iterative construct would be used in C when you want a section of code to be executed repeatedly, such as when a certain condition is true or false.\n",
      "51 A conditional construct would be used in C when you want a section of code to make decisions about what to execute based on certain conditions specified by you in the code.\n",
      "52 An operator is a symbol that is used to perform a certain operation (mathematical or otherwise) on a set of operands. There are many types of operators in C, such as arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, etc. They are each used for a different purpose.\n",
      "53 A function is a block of code that does a certain task. Writing code into a function can make it easier to be called from different parts of the program and can make the program quicker and easier to write.\n"
